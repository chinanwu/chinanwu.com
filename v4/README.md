This is now live at https://chinanwu.com !

First time using Vue for my personal site, and it was a fun one! This project was the first time I really fully designed out what I wanted before jumping into the code.

## The Design

### Mobile Design 
I started with mobile first! There are lots of reasons why (see the very bottom of the README), but for me, mainly, doing so makes it much easier to ensure my site can be responsive beautifully.
